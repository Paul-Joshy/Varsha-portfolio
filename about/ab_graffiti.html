            <p>We have walked by thems hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Sometimes it annoys us, sometimes we admire the talent of its artist, and sometimes we just glance at it and keep walking. Regardless of how we feel about it, graffiti has become a part of our everyday visual experience. From the tiny tags of an experimental teenager to the detailed protest art of a master, graffiti has an important place in culture.</p>
            <p>As we move toward the modern era, graffiti is evident in many cultures. These drawings, paintings, and etchings include poetry, prose, art, and the social issues of the day.</p>
            <p>People are used to seeing graffiti art in public spaces, after all, that's what makes it graffiti. Like all other artistic forms, graffiti has experienced movements or changes in style. From the first tag scribbled on a subway train to the large, complex mural on a billboard, the movement has experienced change. The tools and the means have changed as well. Markers were traded in for spray paint, and stencils and stickers were introduced to make pieces easier to execute in a hurry. Graffiti has always been somewhat political, but it has come a long way from simply tagging one's name to parodying world leaders to make a statement. This is further proof that graffiti is a form of art and not just a result of random acts of vandalism.</p> 
            <p>Graffiti is the first form of art to ever exist. The intentions of our ancestors who created all those ancient cave paintings were the same as those of artists today. Whether it's done on the side of a cave or on the side of a building there really isn't much difference.</p>
            <p>What distinguishes street art from other forms of art is that it is the voice of the public that is meant to be heard by the public. It is important to differentiate this from pure vandalism, because those artists who use the streets as their medium prefer to do so because they wish to be free of the constraints of the formal art community.</p> 
            <p>Where some paintings require a purchase for you to truly appreciate their message, street art is free of cost. It is the voice of the public that is meant to be heard by the public.</p>
