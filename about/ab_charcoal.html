                        From the very beginning, charcoal has been used to create dramatic and realistic drawings. From early cave paintings to modern day art, charcoal has been a versatile medium for artists. It has an exclusive texture when applied on canvas which allows artists to get the required tone and shade with ease. It is realistic to the core which can bring about stunning masterpieces. It is used much the same way as pencils are. It is used for drawing, shading and blending, but there is something psychologically different about using it. </p>
                    
                    <p>Charcoal brings about more expressive work without getting stuck in details. They can also be used to do the preliminary drawings of paintings on canvas. The kinds of charcoal used for sketching purpose are vine and compressed. </p>
                    
                    <p>While vine charcoal usually consists of burnt willow wood and easily spreads on surfaces, compressed charcoal starts out as charred wood dust and other materials to which a binder is added. Binder can be used to control the hardness, so different grades are available. The format varies too, from pastel type to wooden pencils or paper wrapped pencils. Vine charcoal is also natural charcoal, which happens to be harder than willow charcoal and slightly more difficult to erase than willow. It makes a fairly grey black and is much harder to find in art shops than either willow compressed charcoals.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Charcoal sketches can be loose or they can be rendered to a high degree of realism. They are very closely related to paintings. Because of its characteristics, charcoal can easily be spread, blended and erased. This allows it to be used in a variety of ways.</p>
