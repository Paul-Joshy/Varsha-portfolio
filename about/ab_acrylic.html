                    <p>Acrylic paints are water-soluble but become water-resistant when they dry. Depending upon how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolour or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.</p> 
                    
                    <p>These are water-based, which means that unlike oil paints, they can be thinned with water and cleaned with water. They are also non-toxic and non-smelly. Acrylic paints can mimic the quality of oil paints, but without the toxicity and clean-up issues that go along with oils. When thinned with lots of water, acrylics can also mimic the qualities of watercolour.</p>
                    
                    <p>Acrylic paint dries quickly and the main disadvantage of the quick drying time is that sometimes it can be difficult to blend colours.</p>
                    
                    <p>Acrylics are very versatile, which means they can achieve many different effects and be easily used for a variety of styles.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Acrylic paint lends itself well to mixed media applications, which further broadens the possibilities of painting with acrylics. The most popular surfaces for painting with acrylics are canvas, wood, or paper. But once primed with gesso, acrylics can be painted on almost any surface, like fabric, clay, etc. The final finish of the painting can be altered with gloss, matte, or satin varnish. When properly varnished, acrylic paintings do not need to be framed behind glass. They can be hung directly on the wall. </p>
