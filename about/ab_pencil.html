                <p>Drawing executed with an instrument made of graphite enclosed in a wood casing for a sketch or for a more elaborate work in another medium, an exercise in visual expression, or a finished work. </p>
                
                <p>The pencil technique is the most basic of all, and can be referred to as a ‘light outline’ or a ‘heavy outline’. Light outline to create your guidelines and subject guide outlines. To create a light outline, simply reduce any pressure downwards onto the paper and move in a slow and flowing motion. </p>
                
                <p>The Hatching pencil technique is simply marking out small lines bunched together to create fill colour from further away. This technique is a shading technique, and like outlines can be light or heavy by reducing or adding pressure.</p>
                
                <p>The Stipping pencil drawing technique uses the same principle as hatching, but the lines are very small, similar to tiny dashes. This technique is a shading technique, but for smaller areas such as iris’ of the eyes, or even the stubble facial hair. This technique is great for blending if light pressure is used.</p> 
                
                <p>The Back and Forth pencil drawing technique is probably the first shading technique. It is simply moving the pencil in a back and forth motion at a more rapid speed all in the same direction. The pressure to create lighter and heavier pencil shades can be alternated. This technique is useful near the outline of the subject, to ensure the fill shade stays within the correct area. </p>
