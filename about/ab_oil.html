                    <p>In its simplest form, oil paint is a mixture of three things:</p>
                    
                    <p>The pigment, binder and thinner. Pigment is the colour element, while the binder is the liquid vehicle or carrier which holds the pigment to be applied to the canvas. A thinner is usually added to the pigment-oil mixture to make it easier to apply with a brush. Oil paint may also contain a number of other additives, to promote drying, appearance and other necessities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike tempera, acrylic paint or watercolour, all of which dry by evaporation, oil paint dries by oxidation, which means the oil reacts chemically with oxygen in the air and gradually changes from a liquid to a gel and finally becomes hard.</p>
                    
                    <p>The main advantages of oil paints are their flexibility and depth of colour. They can be applied in various ways, from thin glazes diluted with turpentine to dense thick patterns. As it is slow to dry, artists can continue working with the paint for much longer than other types of paint. This provides greater opportunity for blending and layering. Oils also allow the artist to create greater richness of colour as well as a wide range of transitions of tone and shades.</p>
                    
                    <p>In fact oil colours do not change noticeably after drying, and it is possible to produce both opaque and transparent effects, as well as matt and gloss finish. </p>
