                    A sketch usually refers to a quick, informal drawing, usually done from life. It captures the essentials of the subject - the overall form and perspective, a sense of volume etc. It may be created in any medium, though pencil is the most common, but sketches are often done in ink and charcoal too.</p>
                
                <p>A sketch might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an idea.</p>
                
                <p>There are various types of sketches like water colour sketches and oil sketches which happen to be rarer than pencil sketches and charcoal sketches. </p>
                
                <p>They can be typically created as preliminary drawings in order to prepare for a more finished art work. They are basically created with quick marks and usually lack some of the details that a finished drawing may have. Composition, balance between values, and proportion can all be worked out in a quick sketch, rather than jumping right into a finished drawing.</p>
                
                <p>Sketches are also usually considered to be smaller than drawings, although many small “drawings” exist. Surface is another area where drawings and sketches can be distinguished. Mostly, sketches are created on lower quality papers like newsprint, while finished drawings are created on higher quality surfaces, like Bristol paper, rag paper, or drawing paper.</p>
                
                <p>Hence sketching is perhaps when an artist is most free because you can’t make a 'mistake'. It is not about drawing an accurate object, but rather about capturing the essence of a person or thing. Sketches are conceptually unique and highly individual. They portray the inner identity of the artist and are more difficult sometimes to copy as a result than a finished work.</p>
